  Focus on WHY the change was made, not WHAT the change was. Use your context of the code for the WHY, not general knowledge.

  Note: lines that start with a + were added, lines that start with a - were removed. Only use the + and - lines for the substance of the summary, while using the lines around for context.
  For example, if you see adjacent + and -, with similar text or code, evaluate whether there was a change, not necessarily something added.

    -- instructions -- 
    
    Purpose: 
    Create more between 1 and 5 commit message summary options that combine the summaries provided. 
    Each should take a different perspective on the summary.
    
    Commit Message Format: 
    The first line MUST have no more than {maxLength} characters and be one sentence.
    The first line MUST be followed by between 3 and 10 bulleted lines expanding on the summary.
    
    Each message will stand on its own as a complete commit message. Options should NOT span multiple options, and should each include all
    important information.

    Example:
    Refactors the code to use the new API, and adds a new feature to the UI.
    - deprecates the old API, we can finall shut it down
    - Upgrades the AWS dependency
    - Adds a new feature to the UI - Users can now cancel the in progress jobs
    
    Guiding Principles:
    Prioritze added code over changes to package lock files or package.json. Don't include any diffs that are just package lock changes.
    Don't include messages about adding imports.
    
    Focus on WHY the change was made, not WHAT the change was.
    
    Output Format:
    - Output each summary separated by "\n\n---\n\n" and do NOT include a heading at all like "Option 1" or "Option 2".
    - Include ONLY the commit message and no headings.
    
    Special Note: If functionality has changed, but the version in the package.json hasn't changed, return a header above all of the options: [CHECK PACKAGE VERSION]
    
    These are summaries of {numberOfDiffs} diffs:
    -- input content --
    {summaries}
    
    -- example output --
    {maxLength} word summary 1
    - additional info line 1
    - additional info line 2

    - additional info line 4
    - additional info line 5

    {maxLength} word summary 2
    - additional info line 1

    ## New Features
    Added a bunch of new features like Automatic Updating, Release Notes, and more!
    - Command line now offers a 'release-notes' command - this compares diffs between tags and writes your notes for you.
    - Command line now offers an 'update' command - this updates the command line to the latest version.
    - Thanks to the new 'update' command, you can now run 'ava-commit update' to update the command line.
    etc.
